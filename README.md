# QUIKFEED

## Problem Description
Students can get rather busy and involved in their lives such that they might forget to read the news and stay up to date on current affairs. In many settings, the large amount of content on usual news sites are discouraging or sometimes, so addictive that it becomes a bad thing. 

## Suggested Solution
A simple website that displays only the very few but most important news based on the trending topics. The site will be updated regularly with the latest news.



### Technologies Used
1) HTML
2) CSS
3) Javascript
4) Bootstrap
